**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
*This will serve as my professional website, a space to display my background/story, blog, projects, employment details, contact information.*

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
*My target audience would be any interested in software development and design, prospective employers, and my fellow developers!*

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
*I think the main function would be to read about me, browse some of my works/display my skillset, provide contact information, provide resume for employers.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
*1. Design is not "One Size Fits All."
2. User experience isn't the same thing as usability.
3. User expereince design can not be quanatatively measured.*


**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
*User experience design is all about how someone feels when interfacing with a system. This is usually in reference to some sort of human-computer interaction. User Experience Design is important because it can help you determine the best ways to approach accessability, usability, and navigation.*
