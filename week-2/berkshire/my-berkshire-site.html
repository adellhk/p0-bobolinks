	<!-- 
	- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	This went pretty smoothly. Working through the assignment, it was easy to create the html skeleton of the site using most of the basic commands we learned in the codeacademy site, and also from referencing Jon Duckett's text on html and css. 


	- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	We used the link proved to make sure we met html5 criteria, everything checked out. I think because we were keeping it pretty basic, things went super smoothly.

	- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	This was made pretty clear so it was easy to stay away from stylizing our work.

	- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	HTML seems great for the purpose that it serves, which is to organize information on a page into a coherent and familiar structure. I'm eager to learn more about css and I look forward to getting creative with that in the weeks and months ahead.

	- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I don't know that we learned any tricks, but something that wasn't covered in code acedmy was line breaks and horizontal rules which I picked uo by referencing the text.
