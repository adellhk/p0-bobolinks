What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to 
an HTML file? 
Include href, rel, and type. We had some trouble getting this to work properly for some reason.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get 
the site as you wanted it?
We used align and float but it didn't seem to work as well as just using a table.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used font-size, font-weight, and color.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose 
and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We made a few classes to target specific sections, we didn't use any IDs. We used one 
to change the text size of the text next to the links.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had 
cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think ultimately CSS could definately have cleaner and easier to read code, but
we did have some trouble with some of the stylings. I could easilly see though
that css, in a seperate file is much easier to read that a bunch of html styling on the
html page.
