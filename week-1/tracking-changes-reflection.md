## Tracking Changes Reflection

- How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?

This allows developers to see exactly when and what changes were made, and who made them. It provides accountability and accessability.

- What is a commit?

A commit is a checkpoint, or a save. It is a significant addition to the project that is ready to be added into the full project.

- What are the best practices for commit messages?

Be clear about what changes were made and ruse the imperative form of verbs.

- What does the HEAD^ argument mean?

Head^ is the last commit, I feel like I need a little clarification on this...

- What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?

The three stages are an add, a commit, and a push. git add, git commit -m"message here", and git push origin branch_name respecitively. 

- Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes.

git pull - update master branch

git checkout - b branch_name - creates new branch

***write content here***

git add - adds content to be commited

git commit -m "commit message" - commits content

git push origin branch_name - pushes it to github.

- What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?

You can create a pull request on github, an you can also merge the request there. 

- Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams? 

Pull requests are preffered because it allows another member of the team to look over the changes before they are approved in order to make sure there arent any issues the creator may have overlooked.


This was probably the most challenging task thus far. I'm very happy because it feels like I'm learning the command line and git, and this would be day 3 for me :) I think that repetition will cement these concepts and I look forward to more assignments, this is very fun :)
