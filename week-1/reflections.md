# Think About Time:
This week I learned about Meditation, Flow, and Time Boxing.

I learned about meditation through actively practicing it. I downloaded the app Headspace and immediately gave it a try. After listening to the initial instructions, I closed my eyes and allowed the guide to take me through my first session of meditation. Listening to the voice, it wasn't long before I began to feel an array of intricacies that I hadn't really noticed before. There was a small buzz in the distance against the continuous din of the air conditioning, and then the soft vibrations around my mouth and jaw. I breathed in seemingly colder, fresher air; my body felt lighter, I was there and I wasn't. All in all, I think that I will continue on with the 10 minutes of mediation for 10 days and further incorporate mediation into my everyday routine.

The idea of flow was instantly recognizable as something I've studied in game design. In order to keep the player engaged, game designers have to build systems that keep both high and low skilled/experienced players both from boredom, yet also from anxiety. I learned that this could also be applied within the context of work, or really any task for which you seek to attain mastery.

Time Boxing, was a relatively new idea. Time Boxing is assigning a specific amount of time to work on any one thing, and then assess what you were able to accomplish in that given amount of time. An example of this is the Pomodoro technique, which requires you to spend 25 minutes on a particular task followed by a 5 minute break. I think that this method would be extremely useful in phase 0 when approaching the various assignments. Also, the paring sessions are in nature time boxed , so I think it would lend well to getting used to dividing up my time into allotted sessions. 

I think that my current management style is very much in the nature of taking things as they come. I look at the week ahead of me and try to plan out time for each given task. I think that, moving forward, it's going to be important for me to concentrate on creating small specific tasks, rather than focusing on accomplishing huge lofty, less tangible ones.

# The Command Line:
A shell is a user interface, typically a Command Line Interface or a Graphical User Interface, that allows the user direct control to the operating system. Bash, stands for Bourne Again Shell, and is a widely used version of the shell for UNIX.

The most challenging part of this material was piping and redirection. I was able to execute all of the commands successfully, but I feel that I need a bit more practice with the < , > , and |  commands. I think the most important commands are learning how to move through the shell, how to navigate directories and also how to get to and look through the manual. 

pwd = print working directory, ls = list directory, mv = move file, cd = change directory, ../ = go up a directory, touch = make or update a file, mkdir = make directory, less = lets you look at a document one page at a time, rmdir = remove directory, rm = remove file, help or man = brings up the user manual.

# Create, Fork, Clone:
I would say to follow the following steps:

Sign in to Github, view your profile, click on the plus sign in the upper right hand cornor and select new repository.  Next type in the name, select if you want ti to be public or private, determine whether you want to add a license (not sure what they are for yet) and click create.

To fork a repo, find it in Github, click on fork under your profile.

To clone either a new or forked repo to your computer, simply copy the url from github, open up the command line, and type "git clone [repo url here]" (make sure to do this in the directory that you want to work from.)

I think forking a repo gives you access to all the content that has been already created in that repo, where as a new repo will have no data.

Git and Github, seemed to work pretty seamlessly. I've learned how to pull repos, I'm eager to learn how to make and post commits! :) :) :)
