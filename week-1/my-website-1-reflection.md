## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Sign in to Github.com. Next, create a new repository. Next, fill in the name, select whether you want it to be public or private, check whether you want to include a license, and lastly make sure you click for the readme file. Click create. When that is done, on the right hand side of the screen, you will see a clone url, copy that and go over to your terminal. In the terminal type "git clone [paste the url here]"

- Describe what open source means.

Open Source is code that anyone can have access to, the only limits are determined by licenses.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source seems like a great idea! I think it can be a good resource for learning, but also people clearly create open source communities and then profit from them. Who am I to say? haha

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing seems important especially if you want to protect your code for distibution and the like. I think legally its a good idea to set the parameters for your code so that there is a clear understanding of what it can be used for.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

No aha moments just yet. I think the last few assignments are def building my confidence with git and the command line. I'm not really checking guides at this point, I'll stop to think a few seconds of what needs to be done.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I didn't, I think the links provided were helpful.

Another fun challenge! I hope to learn a little more about html and build upon my website! I think its important to return to the command line, and continue getting practice with git too :)
